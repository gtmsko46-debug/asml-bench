"""Process-window-aware OPC ("PW-OPC") workflow.

Production OPC must hold up across a dose/focus *process window*, not just at
nominal exposure. Optimising against the nominal corner alone tends to produce
masks that look great in the lab and fail in the fab.

This module supplies the corner-sweep machinery: define a small set of dose +
defocus corners, run the existing forward model at each, and aggregate the
fidelity loss as a weighted mean. It is a drop-in replacement for the nominal
``F.mse_loss(resist, target)`` line that today lives inside every ILT inner
loop — see ``models.levelset_ilt.LevelSetILTModel`` for the canonical
integration site.

The corner enumeration mirrors the four-corner scheme used by
``benchmark.metrics.pvband.compute_pvband`` so that what we *optimise* and what
we *measure* live in the same world.

Physical caveats (issue #27)
----------------------------

The corner sweep here is a fast inner-loop diagnostic, not rigorous PW
simulation:

* **Defocus is modelled by widening the Gaussian PSF only.** A real
  defocused pupil loses contrast (the MTF dips and re-rings — the
  textbook Bossung curves) — the energy is *redistributed* into the
  pupil's nulls, not merely smeared by a wider real-space kernel. A
  Gaussian preserves total energy, so this proxy under-estimates
  defocus-induced contrast loss; PW corners that are dim in reality
  look only blurry here. For headline PW numbers, drive the Hopkins
  path with measured-source / Zernike-pupil I/O (see ``optics.py``)
  rather than this proxy.
* **Dose enters as a multiplicative scale on the aerial image.** That
  is correct *if* the resist threshold is dose-pinned (the intensity
  the resist clears at scales linearly with dose). The
  ``HopkinsSimulator`` does this internally (issue #52), but this fast
  path uses a *fixed* threshold passed by the caller — so a ±5% dose
  corner cleanly shifts the resist contour rather than being silently
  cancelled. Pair it with ``threshold=0.225`` (LithoBench-canonical)
  for headline alignment with the Hopkins benchmark numbers.

If you require physically-rigorous defocus, use a Hopkins SOCS forward
sim with a defocus Zernike (Z4) and treat this module as the
training-loop proxy.
