    blob.

    Native SEMI P44 multi-beam curve primitives are not yet emitted; the
    polygon approximation is the standard interim representation that all
    multi-beam writer flows accept.

    ``min_area_nm2`` is an opt-in filter for sub-resolution islands: any
    sampled polygon with absolute area below this threshold is dropped

    Hackathon evaluation stays bit-exact. A positive value is intended for
    fab-ready exports where MRC would otherwise reject the smallest SRAFs
    a curvilinear ILT can produce; the count of dropped shapes is logged
    at INFO level so the filter is auditable.

    ``vertex_tolerance_nm`` is an opt-in Ramer-Douglas-Peucker simplification
    on each sampled polygon: any vertex within this perpendicular distance
    of the chord between its surviving neighbours is dropped. Default ``0.0``
    keeps every sampled vertex (bit-exact academic behaviour). Positive
    values cut OASIS file size dramatically on smooth ILT contours — a
