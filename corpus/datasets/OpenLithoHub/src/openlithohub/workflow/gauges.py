"""Gauge file parsing — measurement points used to score OPC fidelity.

A "gauge" is a point on the layout where the foundry / EDA tool measures
the printed CD (critical dimension) and compares it to the target. OPC
recipes are tuned to minimize the EPE (edge-placement error) at these
points. Calibre / Synopsys / commercial OPC pipelines all consume gauge
files; the formats are slightly different but the schema is essentially
the same:

* Calibre ``.gg`` text — whitespace-separated, often with ``# `` comments
  and an optional header line giving the column order.
* Generic CSV — same columns, comma-separated, header row required.

This module returns a uniform ``GaugeTable`` regardless of input format,
so downstream OPC scoring / training code does not have to care which
tool produced the gauges.
