"""Differentiable Mask Rule Check (MRC) loss for curvilinear masks.

Companion to ``benchmark.compliance.mrc.check_curvilinear_mrc`` (post-hoc
binary verdict) and ``sraf.sraf_print_penalty`` (aerial-image-side penalty).
This module gives optimisers a smooth, differentiable signal so curvilinear
ILT / level-set / Neural-ILT models can learn to respect MRC during training
instead of being scored on it afterwards.

Drop into a training loop:

    loss = epe_loss + alpha * curvilinear_mrc_loss(mask, pdk="asap7")

See issue #8 for motivation.

    Three additive terms, each non-negative and zero on a clean mask:

    * **Min-CD** — soft morphological opening with structuring radius
      ``r = floor(min_width_nm / (2 * pixel_size_nm))``. Pixels the mask
      claims that the opening drops contribute ``relu(mask - opening)``,
      summed and normalised by area. This mirrors the binary check in
      ``compliance.mrc.check_mrc`` so the loss and the verdict agree on
      what a violation is.
    * **Min-spacing** — same opening applied to ``1 - mask``; gaps too
      narrow to host the structuring element get penalised.
    * **Min-curvature** — boundary-band integral of the squared image
      gradient. ``‖∇mask‖²`` peaks at sharp transitions, so any region
      where the local gradient magnitude exceeds the curvature budget
      ``1 / min_curvature_radius_nm`` (in per-nm units) is squared-ReLU
      penalised. The "boundary band" is the symmetric difference
      ``dilation(mask, 1) - erosion(mask, 1)``, restricting the cost to
      pixels actually on a contour and keeping the loss well-defined for
      large flat interior regions.

    Args:
        mask: Continuous mask in ``[0, 1]``. Either ``(H, W)`` or
            ``(B, 1, H, W)``.
        pdk: PDK rules to source defaults from. May be a ``PdkRules`` instance
            or a preset name (e.g. ``"asap7"``, ``"freepdk45"``). If ``None``,
            ``min_width_nm``, ``min_spacing_nm``, and ``pixel_size_nm`` must
            all be supplied explicitly.
        min_width_nm: Override for ``pdk.min_width_nm``.
        min_spacing_nm: Override for ``pdk.min_spacing_nm``.
        min_curvature_radius_nm: Minimum allowed local radius of curvature.
            Defaults to ``20 nm`` — looser than typical e-beam writer specs
            so the term doesn't dominate early in training.
        pixel_size_nm: Override for ``pdk.pixel_size_nm``.
        weight_min_cd: Weight for the min-CD term.
        weight_min_spacing: Weight for the min-spacing term.
        weight_min_curvature: Weight for the min-curvature term.

    Returns:
        Scalar ``torch.Tensor`` (autograd-connected). Zero on a fully
