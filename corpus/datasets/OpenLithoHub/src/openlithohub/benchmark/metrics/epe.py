"""Edge Placement Error (EPE) computation.

Two flavors live here:

* :func:`compute_epe` — mask-level. Compares predicted mask edges directly
  to target edges. An Identity model (mask passed straight through) scores
  0 by construction, which is useful as a sanity baseline but does NOT
  reflect what would actually print on the wafer.
* :func:`compute_wafer_epe` — wafer-level. Pushes the predicted mask
  through a forward optical/resist simulator and compares the *resist*
  contour to the target. This is the physically meaningful quantity for
  OPC quality: a square mask will round at the corners after diffraction,
  so an Identity model lands at a nonzero EPE.

Both report the same ``EPEResult`` schema; the leaderboard surfaces them
under separate keys (``epe_*`` vs ``epe_wafer_*``) so existing dashboards
that compare against historical mask-level numbers stay valid.
