"""Cross-tile consistency metrics for tiled ILT workflows.

Full-chip ILT partitions the layout into overlapping tiles and optimises each
independently. Tile-boundary SRAF/curve inconsistency is identified in the
Light:Sci.Appl. 2025 survey as a major artifact source. This module quantifies
that inconsistency so it can be minimised during stitching or used as a
diagnostic in benchmarks.

Metrics provided:

* :func:`tile_boundary_consistency` — compare mask values in the overlap region
  between adjacent tile pairs. Ideal tiled ILT produces identical masks in the
  overlapping area; any discrepancy is a boundary artifact.
* :func:`cross_tile_sraf_consistency` — check that SRAF assist features
  (sub-resolution bars) are continuous across tile edges. Discontinuous SRAFs
  degrade process window locally at the boundary.
* :func:`cross_tile_epe_residual` — edge placement error at tile boundaries.
* :func:`cross_tile_contour_residual` — contour position offset at tile
  boundaries.
* :func:`sweep_overlap_convergence` — sweep overlap width and Schwarz iteration
  count to produce convergence surfaces.
* :func:`schwarz_vs_naive_comparison` — compare Schwarz stitching against naive
  zero-fill stitching.
