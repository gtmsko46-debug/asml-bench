"""L2 wafer error — Neural-ILT canonical mask-printability metric.

The standard academic OPC scoring contract, as established by
[Neural-ILT (ICCAD'20)](https://github.com/cuhk-eda/neural-ilt) and used
by GAN-OPC / MOSAIC, is:

    wafer = lithosim(mask, dose=1.0, threshold=0.225)
    score = (wafer - target).abs().sum()       # L1 / SAD pixel count

i.e. forward-simulate the predicted mask through SOCS optics and the
resist threshold, then count the pixel-wise differences against the
target *layout* (not against the input mask). The result is in pixel
units; multiply by ``pixel_size_nm**2`` for an area in nm² if needed.

Naming note: the published Neural-ILT paper calls this scalar "L2
error". On the binary ``{0, 1}`` wafer/target images the formula
emits, the squared-L2 norm ``(w - t).square().sum()`` and the L1 norm
``(w - t).abs().sum()`` produce the *same* integer (since
``x ∈ {-1, 0, 1} ⇒ x² = |x|``), so reference implementations
canonically use the L1 form for speed. They are *not* equal in general
— if you ever supply a non-binary wafer (e.g. soft resist contours),
the two diverge — but for the canonical contract they agree. The
``l2_error_pixels`` field name is preserved for cross-paper
comparability; do not "fix" it to L1 without coordinating against the
upstream tables.

Like :func:`openlithohub.benchmark.metrics.epe.compute_wafer_epe`, this
metric requires the forward simulator in the loop. The
:func:`compute_epe` mask-level metric scores 0 for an Identity model;
``compute_l2_error`` does not, because diffraction reshapes the printed
contour even when the mask is unchanged.
