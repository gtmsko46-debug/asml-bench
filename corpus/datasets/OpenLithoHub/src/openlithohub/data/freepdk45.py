"""FreePDK45 + NanGate Open Cell Library adapter (single-GDS standard cells).

FreePDK45 is NCSU's 45nm open-source predictive PDK; NanGate's Open Cell
Library provides the standard cells designed against it. The mflowgen
ASIC design kit at https://github.com/mflowgen/freepdk-45nm bundles the
two together as a convenience drop, including a single ``stdcells.gds``
file with all 135 NanGate cells.

This adapter loads a small canonical list of cells (INV_X1, NAND2_X1,
NOR2_X1, DFF_X1) by name and rasterizes one design layer per cell. The
default is metal1 = (11, 0) per the kit's ``rtk-stream-out.map`` (note:
this is *not* the same numbering as ASAP7, where metal1 = (10, 0)).

License caveat
--------------
Unlike ASAP7's clean BSD-3-Clause, the FreePDK45 distribution is two
licenses stacked:

- **FreePDK45** (NCSU): see https://eda.ncsu.edu/freepdk/freepdk45/.
- **NanGate Open Cell Library** (Si2): see
  https://si2.org/open-cell-library/.

The mflowgen mirror at ``github.com/mflowgen/freepdk-45nm`` does not
ship a top-level LICENSE file, so callers MUST verify the upstream
terms themselves before redistributing any derivative work. As with
ASAP7, ``fetch()`` requires explicit ``accept_license=True`` to
acknowledge this responsibility, and the adapter never bundles PDK
bytes into the OpenLithoHub repository.

        design_layer: ``(layer, datatype)`` to rasterize as the design

        pixel_nm: Raster pixel size in nm. Defaults to 1.0; the
            FreePDK45 dbu is 0.1 nm so this is a 10× downsample.
