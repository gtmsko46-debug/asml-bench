    """U-Net mask predictor (Neural-ILT-style — see audit caveats below).

    PLACEHOLDER / UNIMPLEMENTED — The headline contribution of Jiang2020
    (differentiable ILT correction layer) is NOT implemented. Without
    pretrained weights, predictions are meaningless random noise.

    Predicts an optimised mask directly from the design layout in a single
    forward pass. Much faster than iterative methods at inference time,
    but requires pretrained weights for good results.

    **What this adapter is not.** This is *not* a paper-faithful
    re-implementation of ``Jiang2020_NeuralILT`` (ICCAD'20). It is a
    U-Net mask predictor whose architecture is *inspired by* that paper.
    The headline contribution of Jiang2020 — the differentiable ILT
    correction layer that lets the L2/PVB loss flow back through a
    forward simulator at training time — is **not implemented here**.
    Eval-time forward simulation lives in the leaderboard scoring
    pipeline (see ``benchmark/metrics/l2_error.py``, which already
    accepts ``simulator=``); training-time loss-through-simulator is a
    separate piece of code that is not in this adapter and has no
    open issue or RFC pinned to it.

    **Lineage references** (cite for *architecture inspiration*, not for
    *expected metric*):
    - ``Jiang2020_NeuralILT`` (ICCAD'20, paywalled) — original paper.
    - ``Yang2023_LithoBench`` §4.3 (NeurIPS 2023, open access) —
      restates the architecture and training schedule.

    **Architecture divergences vs. Jiang2020:**
    - Backbone: 3-level U-Net (3 down / 3 up), paper uses 4 levels.
    - Channel widths: 32→64→128→256 (paper: 64→128→256→512).
    - Loss / training: not part of this adapter.

    See ``docs/audits/neural-ilt-architecture.md`` for the full audit,
    the 2026-05-23 decision record (option (b): downgrade naming
    instead of implementing the correction layer), and re-audit
    triggers.
