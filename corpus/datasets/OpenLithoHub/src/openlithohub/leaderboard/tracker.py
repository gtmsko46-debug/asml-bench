"""SOTA tracking and leaderboard management.

The store is a single JSON file shared across CLI invocations and the Spaces
app. Read-modify-write therefore needs:
- A POSIX advisory lock (`fcntl.flock`) on a sidecar `.lock` file so two
  concurrent submitters serialize.
- An atomic rename (`tempfile` + `os.replace`) so the file is never
  partially written.

Submission IDs are stored under the public ``submission_id`` field of
``BenchmarkResult`` so they round-trip through `model_validate`.
