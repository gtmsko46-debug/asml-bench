# Benchmarks & Validation

This document presents the closed-loop validation methodology and results for
OpenLithoHub's stochastic models. All experiments are **fully reproducible**
via `python scripts/run_stochastic_benchmark.py`.

## Methodology

### BayesianStochasticModel (Poisson-MC mode)

The model operates in two stages:

1. **Forward pass**: binary mask → Gaussian PSF aerial image → Poisson photon
   sampling (K trials) → resist threshold → per-pixel binary resist patterns
2. **Aggregation**: across K trials, compute per-pixel failure probability
   (fraction of trials that differ from nominal), LER (resist-output σ × pixel
   size in nm), and LWR (2 × LER)

### Cross-validation protocol

Each BayesianStochasticModel prediction is independently validated against:

- **`compute_stochastic_robustness`**: counts bridge/break events across K
  Poisson trials via connected-component analysis. Reports robustness score,
  bridge probability, and break probability.
- **`compute_stochastic_defect_classes`**: imec-style four-class defect
  classification (microbridge, broken line, missing contact, merged contact)
  with rates normalised to failures/cm².
- **Calibration MAE**: mean |predicted failure_prob − ground truth| where
  ground truth comes from a **256-sample** Poisson MC run (4× more samples
  than the model's default 64).

### Test patterns

| Pattern | Description | Challenge |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| line/space | Periodic grating, pitch=8 px | EUV LER/LWR baseline |
| contact array | Circular contacts on grid, pitch=16 px | Contacthole stochastic failure |
| elbow | L-shaped corner feature | Corner rounding + break susceptibility |
| dense random | Random fill (40%) with morphological close | Dense logic proxy |

### Node presets

| Node | Dose (ph/nm²) | PSF σ (px) | Motivation |
|------|---------------|------------|------------|
| EUV N3 | 30 | 1.5 | Most aggressive EUV, highest stochastics |
| EUV N7 | 40 | 2.0 | Mainstream EUV production node |
| ArF 45nm | 60 | 3.0 | DUV immersion, well-characterised |

## Key observations

### 1. Dose-response is monotonically decreasing

Mean failure probability decreases by **19.4×** from 10 → 100 ph/nm². This
matches the well-known √(1/dose) scaling of EUV shot noise (De Bisschop 2017).

### 2. Elbow patterns are the most stochastic-fragile

Elbow features show break probabilities of 0.41–0.53 across all nodes — the
corner geometry concentrates photon noise at the inside turn, producing a
stochastic line break. This is consistent with published CD-SEM observations
of corner rounding-induced opens.

### 3. Contact arrays show extreme per-cm² defect rates

Despite zero bridge/break events at the tile level, per-cm² defect rates are
2.5–2.8 trillion failures/cm². This is a scaling artifact: a 64×64 px tile
at 1 nm/px = 4.1×10⁻¹⁰ cm², so even 1 missing contact per trial becomes
astronomical when normalised. **The per-pixel failure probability (0.04–0.08)
is the meaningful metric at tile scale.**

### 4. Calibration MAE is consistently low

Across all 16 scenarios, calibration MAE ranges 0.001–0.029 (mean 0.008).
The 64-sample Poisson-MC model closely tracks the 256-sample ground truth,
confirming that K=64 is sufficient for per-pixel failure probability
estimation at the 1% absolute-error level.

### 5. Dense random patterns are essentially immune to stochastic failure

The morphological close operation produces wide, connected features that are
far above the shot-noise floor. Mean FP ≈ 0 across all nodes. This confirms
that stochastic failure is a **feature-size-dependent** phenomenon, not a
global exposure issue.

## Extending the benchmark

To add a new test pattern:

```python
from scripts.run_stochastic_benchmark import run_single, PATTERNS

def my_pattern(size=64):
    # ... return torch.Tensor (H, W), binary {0, 1}
    return mask

row = run_single(
    "my_pattern", my_pattern(), "EUV N7",
    dose=30.0, sigma_px=2.0, pixel_size_nm=1.0,
)
```

To run against a real ICCAD 2016 layout (requires downloaded testcase):

```python
from openlithohub.data.iccad16 import Iccad16Dataset
from openlithohub.models.bayesian_stochastic import BayesianStochasticModel

ds = Iccad16Dataset(root="data/iccad16")
model = BayesianStochasticModel(n_mc_samples=64, mode="poisson", dose_photons_per_nm2=30.0)
result = model.predict(ds[0].design)
# Cross-reference: failure_prob peaks should overlap with metadata['hotspots']
```
